Rules
=============
[Original here](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)

Allen Ginsberg’s famous poem on Moloch:

>What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?
>
>Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!
>
>Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!
>
>Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!
>
>Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!
>
>Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories dream and croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities!
>
>Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
>
>Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in Moloch! Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!
>
>Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!
>
>Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!
>
>They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!
>
>Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the American river!
>
>Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit!
>
>Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the flood! Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years’ animal screams and suicides! Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!
>
>Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! to solitude! waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!

What’s always impressed me about this poem is its conception of civilization as an individual entity. You can almost see him, with his fingers of armies and his skyscraper-window eyes.

Many say Moloch represents capitalism. This is definitely a piece of it, even a big piece. But it doesn’t quite fit. Capitalism, whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen? Capitalism in whom I am a consciousness without a body? Capitalism, therefore granite cocks?

Moloch is introduced as the answer to a question – C. S. Lewis’ question in Hierarchy Of Philosophers – what does it? Earth could be fair, and all men glad and wise. Instead we have prisons, smokestacks, asylums. What sphinx of cement and aluminum breaks open their skulls and eats up their imagination?

And Ginsberg answers: Moloch does it.

There’s a passage in the Principia Discordia where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. “Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.”

The Goddess answers: “What is the matter with that, if it’s what you want to do?”

Malaclypse: “But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!”

Goddess: “Oh. Well then stop.”

If everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: “Moloch”. This thought is powerful not because it’s correct – nobody literally thinks an ancient Carthaginian demon causes everything – but because thinking of the system as an agent throws into relief the degree to which the system isn’t an agent.

Nick Bostrom makes an offhanded reference of the possibility of a dictatorless dystopia, one that every single participant hates but which nevertheless endures unconquered. It’s easy enough to imagine such a state. Imagine a country with two rules: first, every person must spend eight hours a day giving themselves strong electric shocks. Second, if anyone fails to follow a rule (including this one), or speaks out against it, or fails to enforce it, all citizens must unite to kill that person. Suppose these rules were well-enough established by tradition that everyone expected them to be enforced.

So you shock yourself for eight hours a day, because you know if you don’t everyone else will kill you, because if they don’t, everyone else will kill them, and so on. Every single citizen hates the system, but for lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures. From a god’s-eye-view, we can optimize the system to “everyone agrees to stop doing this at once”, but no one within the system is able to effect the transition without great risk to themselves.

This example is kind of contrived. So let’s run through some real world examples of similar multipolar traps to really hammer in how important this is.


1. [The Prisoner’s Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma), as played by two libertarians who keep ending up on defect-defect. There’s a much better outcome available if they could figure out the coordination, but coordination is hard or impossible under some conditions. From a god’s-eye-view, we can agree that cooperate-cooperate is a better outcome than defect-defect, but neither prisoner within the system can make it happen.

2. [Dollar Auctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction). Using some weird auction rules, you can take advantage of poor coordination to make someone pay $10 for $1. From a god’s-eye-view, clearly people should not pay $10 for $1. From within the system, each individual's decisions were consistently rational.

3. [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) 
>Let’s consider fish farming in a lake. Imagine a lake with a thousand identical fish farms owned by a thousand competing companies. Each fish farm earns a profit of $1000/month. For a while, all is well.
>
>Each fish farm produces waste, which fouls the water in the lake. Let’s say each fish farm produces enough pollution to lower productivity in the lake by $1/month.
>
>A thousand fish farms produce enough waste to lower productivity by $1000/month, meaning none of the fish farms are making any money. Capitalism to the rescue: someone invents a filtering system that removes waste products. It costs $300/month to operate. All fish farms voluntarily install it, the pollution ends, and the fish farms are now making a profit of $700/month.
>
>But one farmer (Steve!!!) gets tired of spending the money to operate his filter. Now one fish farm worth of waste is polluting the lake, lowering productivity by $1. Steve earns $999 profit, and everyone else earns $699 profit.
>
>Everyone else sees Steve is much more profitable than they are, because he’s not spending the maintenance costs on his filter. They disconnect their filters too.
>
>Once four hundred people disconnect their filters, Steve is earning $600/month – less than he would be if he and everyone else had kept their filters on! And the poor virtuous filter users are only making $300. Steve goes around to everyone, saying “Wait! We all need to make a voluntary pact to use filters! Otherwise, everyone’s productivity goes down.”
>
>Everyone agrees with him, and they all sign the Filter Pact, except one person (Mike!!!) who is sort of a jerk. Now everyone is back using filters again except Mike. Mike earns $999/month, and everyone else earns $699/month. Slowly, people start thinking they too should be getting big bucks like Mike, and disconnect their filter for $300 extra profit.
>
>A self-interested person never has any incentive to use a filter. A self-interested person has some incentive to sign a pact to make everyone use a filter, but in many cases has a stronger incentive to wait for everyone else to sign such a pact but opt out himself. This can lead to an undesirable equilibrium in which no one will sign such a pact.




## How to Play
You can check out how to play on our [wiki](https://github.com/huytd/agar.io-clone/wiki/How-to-Play).

#### Game Basics
- Move your mouse around the screen to move your cell.
- Eat food and other players in order to grow your character (food respawns every time a player eats it).
- A player's **mass** is the number of food particles eaten.
- **Objective**: Try to get as big as possible and eat other players.

#### Gameplay Rules
- Players who haven't eaten yet cannot be eaten as a sort of "grace" period. This invincibility fades once they gain mass.
- Everytime a player joins the game, **3** food particles will spawn.
- Everytime a food particle is eaten by a player, **1** new food particle will respawn.
- The more food you eat, the slower you move to make the game fairer for all.

## FAQ
1. **What is this game?**

  This is a clone of the game [Agar.IO](http://agar.io/). Someone said that Agar.IO is a clone of an iPad game called Osmos, but we haven't tried it yet. (Cloneception? :P)
  
2. **Why would you make a clone of this game?**

  Well, while the original game is still online, it is closed-source, and sometimes, it suffers from massive lag. That's why we want to make an open source version of it: for educational purposes, and to let the community add the features that they want, self-host it on their own servers, have fun with friends and more.
  
3. **Any plans on adding an online server to compete with Agar.IO or making money out of it?**

  No. This game belongs to the open-source community, and we have no plans on making money out of it nor competing with anything. But you can of course create your own public server, let us know if you do so and we can add it to our Live Demos list!
  
4. **Can I deploy this game to my own server?**

  Sure you can! That's what it's made for! ;)
  
5. **I don't like HTML5 canvas. Can I write my own game client with this server?**

  Of course! As long as your client supports WebSockets, you can write your game client in any language/technology, even with Unity3D if you want (there is an open source library for Unity to communicate with WebSockets)!
  
6. **Can I use some code of this project on my own?**

  Yes you can.
